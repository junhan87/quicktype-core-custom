# quicktype-core-custom

quicktype-core-custom is a project forked out from quicktype-core@6.0.66 to customize the generated code in C++ from AsyncAPI input.
quicktype-core is a project with typescript, however due to the version (6.0.66) I have already deployed to project, I need to modify code
from version 6.0.66 to avoid too much deviation in generated code. 
Hence I modify the compiled javascript files directly.

## Installation

npm i quicktype-core-custom
